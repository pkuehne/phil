# Phil - Photo/Individuals Linker (for genealogy)

Phil allows you to add metadata to your ancestral photos like when it was taken, where and who is in the photo. The data is stored alongside the photo in a YAML file, which is simple to read with any text editor. There is no lock-in and the data is easy to move around along with the photo.

To try it out, download the [latest release](https://github.com/pkuehne/grant/releases/latest).
